# Large Language Models for Biomedical Research
## A Collaborative Research Initiative

### 📋 Overview

This repository serves as the collaborative workspace for our research group exploring the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in biomedical and bioinformatics contexts. Our focus is on developing and evaluating AI-driven research methods with an emphasis on benchmarking, reproducibility, and trustworthiness.

**Duration:** September - December 2024  
**Meeting Format:** Weekly group meetings + individual sessions as needed

### 🎯 Mission Statement

To develop principled approaches for deploying LLMs in technical biomedical tasks, ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and transparency while advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.

### 🔬 Core Research Framework

We utilize the framework available at [github.com/biomathematicus/FOO](https://github.com/biomathematicus/FOO), as described in [A Mathematical Theory of Discursive Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565).

### 🧬 Primary Test Case: MaHPIC Dataset

The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction (MaHPIC) dataset, specifically experiments 6 and 7, serves as our primary test case. This rich dataset includes:
- RNA sequencing data
- Targeted proteomics
- Metabolomics
- Continuous physiological measurements at high frequency

**Central Question:** Why do some individuals demonstrate resilience while others exhibit severe responses to infection?

### 🔍 Research Areas

#### 1. Multimodal Integration
Developing methods to synthesize transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and physiological data into coherent models using LLM-based analysis pipelines.

#### 2. Causal Inference
Moving beyond association to identify causal mechanisms of resilience versus susceptibility through structural equation modeling and counterfactual reasoning integrated with LLM-assisted analysis.

#### 3. Evaluation Frameworks
Defining quantitative benchmarks for LLM performance including:
- Accuracy metrics
- Reproducibility measures
- Interpretability scores
- Computational efficiency

#### 4. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
Incorporating data governance, privacy protection, and responsible AI practices appropriate for biomedical contexts.

#### 5. Scalability and Generalization
Exploring whether methods developed for malaria can generalize to other infectious diseases or chronic conditions.

#### 6. Human-AI Collaboration
Investigating optimal strategies for combining domain expertise with AI-agent recommendations, including workflow design and user interface considerations.
